## Blog Post of Final Data Story for COMM318 Group Project

This folder includes our final data story "The Opioid Epidemic: How It Has Affected Connecticut and the Entire US" in notebook form. In this story, we explore two major research questions: 

### 1) How has the opioid crisis affected Connecticut?
### 2) How does this data fit into the larger federal opioid crisis?

We used a variety of datasets from data.gov to render plots, regressions, and geographical maps and convey key ideas in our story. Our target audience is the general American public, focusing on those who are interested in the opioid crisis and/or interested in the intersection of healthcare and data science. In addition, individuals from the state of Connecticut may find our Connecticut-specific insights particularly helpful. 

We hope our data story can ignite conversations about the opioid epidemic across the nation. Considering the decreasing proportion of legal medical opioid prescriptions and the increasing number of deaths and rehab admissions, we would like to highlight the possibility of the growing presence of illegal opioids which has both socioeconomic and political implications. Moreover, opioid addiction is a serious problem that adversely affects the lives of people using the drugs as well as the lives of people around them.

Please enjoy reading our final data story, and thank you for your time and attention to this crucial topic.
